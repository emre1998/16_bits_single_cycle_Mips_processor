# 16_bits_single_cycle_Mips_processor

This VHDL codes describes the architecture of a single-cycle MIPS processor. 
The processor consists of several components, including the PC (program counter),
instruction memory, control unit, register file, ALU (arithmetic logic unit), and several multiplexers and signals.


The code starts with the entity declaration for the MIPS processor, which has two input ports (clk and reset) and two output ports (pc_out and alu_result). The architecture section includes the signals and components required to implement the processor.
The process for the PC updates the current PC value to the next PC value on the rising edge of the clock signal. The PC is initialized to x"0000" when the reset signal is asserted.

The instruction memory is implemented as a separate entity, which is instantiated using the Instruction_Memory_VHDL component. The instruction memory takes the current PC value as an input and outputs the 16-bit instruction stored at that location
The control unit is implemented using the control_unit_VHDL entity, which takes the opcode of the current instruction as an input and generates the control signals required for the other components of the processor.

The register file is implemented using the register_file_VHDL entity, which consists of two read ports and one write port. The register file takes the read and write addresses and data as inputs and outputs the data stored in the specified register.


The ALU is implemented using the ALU_VHDL entity, which performs arithmetic and logical operations on the two input values based on the control signals generated by the control unit. The ALU outputs the result of the operation and a zero flag, which indicates whether the result is zero.

There are also several multiplexers and signals that are used to select between different inputs to the components based on the control signals generated by the control unit. These include the multiplexers for the reg_write_dest and read_data2 signals, as well as several signals for the immediate value and jump address calculations.

Overall, this VHDL code provides a functional implementation of a single-cycle MIPS processor that can execute a subset of the MIPS instruction set.
